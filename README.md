Inspired by Coursera specialization 'AI for Medicine'

- Open the `main.ipynb` notebook which demonstrates how chest x-ray image dataset can be used to model a `condition` prediction system 
- This notebook demonstrates several concepts like
1. Data Leakage
2. Data visualization and Preprocessing
3. Dealing with data imbalance
4. Transfer Learning
5. Confusion Matrix

- For testing, please clone the repository, download the images via the following link `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l45F76dmBEki-4JKvUH4XPyxYSQp5-Ah/view?usp=sharing` and extract the contents into the `Data/images` path

- Constructive critism is always welcome :)
